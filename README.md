# What is Silicon?

Silicon is a camera mod for Cubic Castles that allows for greater control of the in-game camera.
___
## Available Tools:

### Default:
Unlocks camera rotation along the vertical axis to allow the camera to see up.

### Freecam:
Allows the camera to operate independently from the player. Once activated, you are able to move your camera using W A S D, Shift & Space, and look around using I J K L. Camera movement and rotation speeds can be adjusted accordingly in the settings.

### Field of View:
Adjusts the amount of world space that the camera can see at any given moment. This setting ranges from 10 degrees to 135 degrees, with 60 as the default.

### Distance to Focal Point:
Places the camera at this set distance away from the target it orbits around. Setting this to 1 emulates a first person PoV camera. 

### Hide Player:
An optional toggle that makes the player model invisible, which is useful when using the first person camera.

### Cinematics:
An animation engine built upon Freecam. Capture keyframes at different locations, and the engine will animate a smooth path going from frame to frame. 
Using this tool is pretty straightforward. Enable Freecam, move and the camera to the desired coordinates and rotation, and add frame. Repeat for as many frames you need, and when done press play.


# Installation & Usage
See the [releases](https://github.com/TreacherousDev/Silicon/releases) section and install the most recent version.
Set up the installation, launch the batch file included, and then run the program alongside Cubic Castles.
If the program does not work, closing and reopening it should fix it.

Enabling Freecam disables camera control from the main game itself. You must use the hotkeys included in the tooltip below to move around. Make sure that Silicon is the active window while you are pressing the hotkeys or it wouldn't work.
