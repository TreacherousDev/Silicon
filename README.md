# Installation & Usage
See the [releases](https://github.com/TreacherousDev/Silicon/releases) section and install the most recent version.
Set up the installation, launch the batch file included, and then run the program alongside Cubic Castles.
If the program does not work, closing and reopening it should fix it.

Enabling Freecam disables camera control from the main game itself. You must use the hotkeys included in the tooltip below to move around. Make sure that Silicon is the active window while you are pressing the hotkeys or it wouldn't work.
